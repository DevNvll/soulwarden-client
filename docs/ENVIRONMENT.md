# The environment of the world

The runtime part of the world look (the milestone "WF World fidelity" of the roadmap): the time of day of the backend clock, and
later the sun, the sky, the fog, the exposure, the local lights of the slices, and the water. The world track does the terrain and the
mesh materials. The stages of the environment come from the research plan (`~/Games/soulwarden-client/research/world-environment.md`)
and the orchestrator.

The sources: Soulwarden `docs/systems/world-time-and-weather.md` and the protocol notes 4.43 (read only), the research
`~/Games/soulwarden/work/research/world-time.md` (section 2: the client code of the time), and the backend encoders
(`apps/backend/src/server/rep/time_messages.cpp`, `world/world_time.cpp`).

## The world clock

The world has one day and night cycle. The backend owns it; the client calculates the time of day itself from one record and its
copy of the server clock, as the retail client does. The server sends no hour stream.

| Part | Rule (source) |
| --- | --- |
| The request | 4248 `TimeComponentServerFacet_SyncToClient`: target G + D41EB32C0F154004 (the Time facet of the own player), entity G; 16 bytes. The session sends it one time at the world entry (when the own entity is known). The retail client sends it after the mission load of the world level (live check L0 of the backend); a travel and a respawn keep the record (L2). |
| The record | 7036 `TimeComponentClientFacet_SyncTimeAndPhase`: the call, the record of 60 bytes, the phase (80 bytes). The backend sends it to the request, at each command for the world time, and one cycle after the last record. The record: the cycle (06:00 to 19:00 in 1,800 real s, 19:00 to 06:00 in 900 real s: 26 and 44 game seconds in one real second), the anchor on the server clock (one cycle back), the offset, and the four phase edges. |
| The phase | 4247 `TimeComponentClientFacet_SyncDayPhase`: the phase of the backend at each phase change (night 0, dawn 1, day 2, dusk 3). Dawn is 06:00 to 06:26 (60 real s), dusk 18:34 to 19:00. |
| The server clock | The registration reply and 335 each 3 s (the clock of `SwcRepClient`: a difference of more than 1 s moves it at once). |
| The time of day | `Net/Codec/SwcWorldTime.h`: `cycle_part` (client code 0x6A0ADC0: the float32 time from the anchor plus the float32 year times the offset, then the remainders), `game_second` (0x6A09E60: the night part before dawnStart, the day part to nightStart, the night part after it), `phase_at` (0x6A08270), `engine_hour` (0x6434700: steps of one game second). |
| The world subsystem | `Environment/SwcWorldTimeSubsystem`: `HasWorldTime`, `GetGameSecond`, `GetHour`, `GetPhase` (the edges of the record), `GetServerPhase` (the last 7036 or 4247). It reads the record from the session each 0.25 s and calculates the time in each frame. Before the first record there is no world time (the retail client keeps the hour of the mission). |

Nothing uses the hour yet: the sun, the sky, and the lights are the next stages.

The tests: `tools/test-environment.sh` builds `tests/environment/world_time_tests.cpp` with the encoders of the backend (7036, 4247,
335), the checks of its session for 4248, and its day cycle (`day_cycle::record`, `client_part`, `game_second`, `phase_of`): the
fields of the record, the part of the cycle equal to the client model of the backend, and the hour and the phase of the client against
the backend cycle over two cycles (seven starts: the edges, the midnight wrap, an early server clock with the anchor 1, three days of
uptime; the largest difference 0.034 game seconds, below 1 ms of real time), the rates (260 game seconds in 10 real seconds by day,
440 by night).

### Check (development run, 2026-10-18)

`tests/environment/world-time-routes.txt` (the routes: reads of the world time of the backend with the wall time of each reply, and
the commands 18:58:30, 05:59:00, and 12:00 for the world), with
`SWC_DEV_CHARACTER=Devwarden SWC_STAGE=WF-clock tools/creature-check.sh worldtime 115 tests/environment/world-time-routes.txt -- -SwcWorldTimeProbe`,
then `python3 -B tools/lib/world_time_compare.py ~/Games/soulwarden-client/evidence/WF-clock worldtime`; evidence
`~/Games/soulwarden-client/evidence/WF-clock/` (`worldtime.mp4`, `worldtime-sheet.png`, the logs, `worldtime-compare.txt`).

- The session: one request 4248 at the world entry, 0 refused; the backend sent 4 records 7036 (the request and the three commands)
  and 3 phases 4247 (night at 19:00, dawn at 06:00, day at 06:26).
- The compare with the hour of the server at 18 points (the 4 records, the 3 phase edges of the backend log, 8 reads and 3 commands
  of the routes): the largest difference 0.42 game seconds (about 16 ms of real time: one frame of the log line). The phase edges of
  the client and of the backend log are within 10 ms.
- The debug line shows the time and the phase of the server: 13:00 (day), 19:05 (night), 06:03 (dawn), 06:27 (day).
- Tests: `tools/test-environment.sh` 67 checks; `tools/test-net.sh` 179, `tools/test-items.sh` 30, `tools/test-movement.sh` 27 (the
  tools that build `SwcRepClient.cpp`): 0 failures.

## Development aids

| Switch or command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| The debug line | "world time HH:MM:SS (PHASE), hour H, phase of the server PHASE" on the screen, after the first record. |
| `-SwcWorldTimeProbe` | The log line of the time each 1 s (else each 60 s, at each record, and at each phase edge). |
| `tools/lib/dev_world.py world-time [HH:MM[:SS]]` | The world time of the backend with the wall time of the reply (`wall`), or a command for the world (the development route `/v1/dev/world/time`; development data only). |
| `tools/lib/world_time_compare.py FOLDER LABEL` | The compare of the client clock (the log lines of `-SwcWorldTimeProbe`) with the records, the phase edges, and the reads of the server in one run; exit status 1 above 1 game second. |
